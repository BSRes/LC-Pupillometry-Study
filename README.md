# Pupillometry Analysis for "The Role of Brain Arousal Systems in Prediction and Expectation"

This repository contains the Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks used for data acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis for the rotation project titled "The Role of Brain Arousal Systems in Prediction and Expectation: A pilot study investigating pupil responses to unexpected stimuli under high vs low attentional load."

## Project Overview

This pilot study investigated whether pupil diameter, an indirect index of Locus Coeruleus (LC) activity, reflects stimulus expectation signals and if such signals are modulated by attentional load. The study involved a visual oddball task with varying attentional demands. Pupil responses were analyzed using a deconvolution General Linear Model (GLM) with a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) model.

## Code Structure

*   **`main.py`**: Main PsychoPy script for running the experiment.
*   **`config.py`**: Configuration file for experimental parameters.
*   **Helper Scripts (`.py` files in the root directory)**: Modules for specific tasks like stimulus generation (`generate_main_stimuli.py`), block planning (`plan_blocks_and_sessions.py`), experimental logic (`block_handler.py`, `run_practice.py`), etc.
*   **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files, likely in a `notebooks/` or analysis directory):**
    *   `EDF_Reader.ipynb`: Parses raw EyeLink EDF data into a usable format.
    *   `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Contains steps for cleaning and preprocessing pupil data (artifact rejection, interpolation, filtering).
    *   `Deconvolution.ipynb`: Implements the FIR deconvolution GLM to estimate pupil response functions.
    *   `Data_Analysis_-_Deconvolution_ANOVA.ipynb`: Performs statistical analysis (ANOVA) on the derived beta coefficients.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   PsychoPy
*   Pandas
*   NumPy
*   SciPy
*   Statsmodels
*   Pingouin
*   Matplotlib
*   Seaborn
*   Pylink (for EyeLink integration)

A `requirements.txt` file may be added in the future for easier environment setup.

## Setup Notes

*   **EyeLink Integration:**
    *   The `EyeLinkCoreGraphicsPsychoPy.py` script, required by `main.py`, is part of the SR Research EyeLink Developer's Kit. It should be placed in the same directory as `main.py` or in your Python path.
    *   Calibration sound files (if used, though currently set to "" in `main.py`) would also typically come from the EyeLink Developer's Kit.
*   **Stimuli:** Main visual stimuli (Gabor patches, noise disk) are generated by `generate_main_stimuli.py` if not already present in the `stimuli_images/` directory (as defined in `config.py`).
*   **Names:** When running the psychopy experiment, the subject is prompted to enter their name. Letters A-Z are expected. Most of the scripts included for extraction, preprocessing, and analysis assume names of 4 repeating letters; "aaaa" - "ffff".

## Usage

1.  **Experiment:** Run `main.py` using PsychoPy to collect data.
2.  **Data Processing & Analysis:** Execute the Jupyter Notebooks in the recommended order:
    1.  `EDF_Reader.ipynb`
    2.  `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`
    3.  `Deconvolution.ipynb`
    4.  `Data_Analysis_-_Deconvolution_ANOVA.ipynb`

Please ensure all paths in `config.py` and within the notebooks are correctly set for your environment.
